# Arm-Processor-Game
"Simon" game on imbedded system.
This game is intended to be run on an Arm32 processor. It is a version of the board game "Simon." It involves matching a random pattern
of button presses, up to ten presses in a row. The user is given a pattern and has to repeat it back, using the Wii Nunchuk controller
for input. This project requires a large amount of drivers to run properly on the board, some written by others, and some written by a
partner and me.

Note: This will not work! No graphics or sound files are included here, rendering the game unplayable. It also requires a particular
version of the Arm processor to work correctly.
